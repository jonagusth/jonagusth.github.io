          In this project we look and analize car ownership for Copenhagen
          metropolitan area in the period of time between 2006 and 2020. We

          The topic of sustainability and living an environmentally friendly
          lifestyle is constantly growing. Denmark is one of the frontrunners of
          implementing the United Nations Sustainable development goals and
          Copenhagen is a hub for innovation and development of sustainable
          solutions. In the recent years there has been a shift in car
          ovnership. People are more and more switching from benzin and disel
          cars to more sustainable elecric and hybrid cars. <br />
          First let's look at how car ownershipt in Copenhagen has been
          developing.
