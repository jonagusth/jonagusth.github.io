          This website is developed for the course 02806 Social Data Analysis 
          and Visualization at Danmarks Tekniske Universitet. 
          The project describes car ownership for the Copenhagen
          metropolitan area in the period of time between 2006 and 2020. The data used is
          loaded from
          <a href="https://kk.statistikbank.dk/statbank5a/default.asp?w=1536"

          and <a href="https://www.opendata.dk/">Open Data DK</a>
          . The raw data includes tables on new private cars registered every
          year in every district in Copenhagen. The data was plotted
          using different visualization tools that include bar plots, scatter
          plots and maps. The data and jupyter notebook used to perform these visualizations can be found 
          <a href="https://github.com/jonagusth/SoicalDataAssets">here</a> The goal is to analyze and look for trends and
          singularities. The visualization focuses on:

        <h4>Car registration in Copenhagen between 2006 - 2020</h4>
        <p class="text-start p-3">
          The topic of sustainability and living an environmentally friendly 
          lifestyle is constantly growing. Denmark is one of the frontrunners in
          implementing the United Nations Sustainable development goals and
          Copenhagen is a hub for innovation and the development of sustainable 
          solutions. In recent years there has been a shift in car ownership. People are more and more switching from gasoline and diesel cars to more sustainable electric and hybrid cars.
          First, let's look at how car ownership in Copenhagen has been developing.
          <br /><br />
          The amount of registered cars has been growing since 2006. There are some years where the growth slows down, for instance, 2009 and 2010. That is most likely due to the world economic crisis. After 2013 the number of cars increases constantly. Is it because people living in Copenhagen are buying more cars than before or is there another explanation?

          The figure on the right shows the population in Copenhagen during the 
          same time period as the car registration trends above. There has been 
          a steady growth in population over time, similar to the growth in 
          registered cars. It seems that the awareness of the climate crisis and 
          the focus on public transport has not affected car registration. However 
          when the car registrations and population  data are compared it can be
          seen that even though car registrations went up 30.6% from 2006 -
          2020, the population for the same time period went up 20.7%. This
          explains some of the new car registration increases but not all.

          On the stacked bar chart to the left, it can be seen that the amount of 
          Hybrid and Electric cars are only a fraction of the total car registrations, 
          even in 2019 and 2020. This graph is very hard to read due to the huge 
          difference in car registration by type. In this case, it is much
          more informative to look at the same data using logarithmic scales and
          to look at the percentage changes in a different type of cars between
          years.

                Looking at percentage changes from year to year is useful for spotting big changes.
                The plot to the right informs us about crucial years for the electric and hybrid car industry in Copenhagen. In 2013 there was a big change in the trend of electric cars with rapid growth in the number of new cars per year. For hybrid cars, this change in trend occurred in 2018. In In contrast we see the number of diesel and gasoline cars is increasing
                slower than in previous years.

          Using a logarithmic scale allows us to see the trends by type of car even 
          though the amount of diesel and gasoline cars are way higher than the amount 
          of hybrid and electric cars. Gasoline car ownership had a drop after the 2008 
          global crisis but began increasing again in 2013. The
          Diesel cars have more or less a linear growth over the whole time
          period but there is a clear change in 2019, exactly after the Danish
          parliament political proposal of reducing gasoline and diesel cars in
          the whole country. Both hybrid and electric cars seem to have
          exponential growth after 2016.
          <br /><br />
          There have been a lot of political changes in Denmark in the last few years 
          regarding tax and car production. Danish regulations of taxing cars have drastically 
          changed since 2013. Registration <strong>exemptions of 105 - 180%</strong> were introduced for 
           <strong>electric and hybrid cars</strong>, and also green owner tax exemptions. This is remarkable 
           considering that car taxes can be over 200% of the car price in Denmark. This is changing in 2021 where 
           the tax on green cars is increasing but still remains significantly 
           lower than fossil fuel cars. On the other hand, <strong>EV battery costs</strong> have been <strong>decreasing</strong> 
           worldwide since 2015. There have also been <strong>dramatic decreases in hardware costs</strong> for standard
          charging stations and car battery lifetimes have also improved.
          Another change important to note is that there has been an <strong>increase in
          number of electric and hybrid car manufacturers</strong>, for example, Toyota
          and Seat and other affordable electric and hybrid car models.
